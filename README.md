<h1 align="center">Online News Portal</h1>

> The system that is going to be developed is Online News Portal (ONP). This online newspaper application is to be used by online users who love to read news anonymously. The system only keeps a few records for authorized users like username, password, and their comments for the news and none for unauthorized users. This system does not track any user activity as the system gives users to search and read the news without any condition. This project intends to make news available online for everyone.
